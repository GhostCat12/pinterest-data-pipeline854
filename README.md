# Pinterest Data Pipeline


[Pinterest](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en-gb/company/) is a visual discovery engine designed to provide ideas and inspiration. As each user interacts through viewing posts, following or uploading, Pinterest crunches billions of data points every day to decide how to provide more value to their users. 

This project aims to design an end-to-end pipeline utilising AWS cloud technologies and Databricks for analysing real-time and historical pinterest-emulated data.

## ðŸ“„ Data 

Infrastructure similar to what is found if data engineer working at Pinterest. 

user_posting_emulation.py, that contains the login credentials for a RDS database, which contains three tables with data resembling data received by the Pinterest API when a POST request is made by a user uploading data to Pinterest:

### **pinterest_data :** contains data about posts being updated to Pinterest
    
> Example data:

    {'index': 7528, 'unique_id': 'fbe53c66-3442-4773-b19e-d3ec6f54dddf', 'title': 'No Title Data Available', 'description': 'No description available Story format', 'poster_name': 'User Info Error', 'follower_count': 'User Info Error', 'tag_list': 'N,o, ,T,a,g,s, ,A,v,a,i,l,a,b,l,e', 'is_image_or_video': 'multi-video(story page format)', 'image_src': 'Image src error.', 'downloaded': 0, 'save_location': 'Local save in /data/mens-fashion', 'category': 'mens-fashion'}


### **geolocation_data :** contains data about the geolocation of each Pinterest post

> Example data:

    {'ind': 7528, 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2020, 8, 28, 3, 52, 47), 'latitude': -89.9787, 'longitude': -173.293, 'country': 'Albania'}

### **user_data contains :** data about the user that has uploaded each Pinterest post

> Example data:

    {'ind': 7528, 'first_name': 'Abigail', 'last_name': 'Ali', 'age': 20, 'date_joined': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 24, 11, 23, 51)}


## ðŸ›  The Pipeline Build  


#### Details of steps taken can be found in the `project_log.ipynb`file. 

### 1. Setting up project environment
    - Setup a conda enviroment and install required libraires 

### 2. Exploring the Pinterest emulation data. 
As shown under the [Data](#data) section. 

### 3. Batch processing: Configuring EC2 Kafka client

Create an MSK cluster, and connect it to an established EC2 instance which will act as an Apache Kafka client.
The EC2 client has Kafka, Java and IAM MSK authentication packages installed which allows for the authentication and connection of the EC2 to the MSK cluster. Using the EC2 client, three Kafka topics can now be created.    


### 4. Connect MSK cluster to an S3 bucket
Next, configure MSK Connect to enable the MSK cluster to automatically transmit and store data to an S3 bucket, that is partitioned by topic. This is achieved by downloading the Confluent.io Amazon S3 Connector and adding it to the S3 bucket through the EC2 client, on the other hand creating a connector in MSK connect by using a custom plugin (which is designed to connect to the S3 bucket).


### 5. Configuring API in API gateway

Construct a REST API within the API gateway with the EC2 network as the endpoint. Then on the EC2 client side, install the Confluent package to listen for requests, which allows the REST proxy API to interact with the Kafka cluster and thus the MSK cluster.

Update the `user_posting_emulation.py` script, to add a function which posts data messages to the cluster via the API gateway and the Kafka REST proxy. Building upon this script, construct a second script `user_posting_emulation_batch.py` to send messages to the EC2 client through three endpoints (one for each topic), consequently sending it to the MSK cluster which is connected to the three topics inside the S3 bucket. 


### 6. Mount AWS S3 bucket onto Databricks

In order to clean and query the batch data, mounting the S3 bucket on Databricks is required. Therefore, a notebook `pinterest_autenticate_aws` was created to read and extract the delta table containg the AWS keys to Databricks sparks dataframe, 
and another notebook 'mount_S3_bucket was created to house a mounting function to mount the S3 bucket to Databricks. 
The third notebook `pinterest_batch_data` reads the json data from the s3 bucket topics and creates three Spark dataframes, one for each topic (user, pin, and geo).

### 7. Clean and query the data on databricks: 

Clean the three dataframes df_pin, df_geo, df_user and query the data on databricks using pyspark. Detailed steps on the cleaning function can be found in `cleaning_utils` notebook. THe cleaning function is run inside the `piterest_batch_data` notebook, it also houses code on the queries.

#### Queries were as follows:

1. Find the most popular Pinterest category people post to based on their country.
2. Find the most popular category in each year between 2018 and 2022
3. Find the user with most followers in each country
4. What is the most popular category people post to for different age groups?
5. What is the median follower count for users in different age groups?
6. Find how many users have joined each year between 2015 and 2020
7. Find the median follower count of users based on their joining year between 2015 and 2020.
8. Find the median follower count of users based on their joining year and age group for 2015 to 2020.


### 8. Batch processing: AWS MWAA 

Orchestrate Databricks workloads on AWS MWAA by uploading `0a60b9a8a831_dag.py`, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to an AWS MWAA environment via its associated S3 bucket, `mwaa-dags-bucket/dags`. This initiates @daily execution.

### 9. Stream Processing: AWS Kinesis

Moving on to processing streaming data. Three data streams can be created on AWS Kinesis, one for each of the tables pin, user, and geo. Modify the previously created REST API to invoke Kinesis actions to 
1. List steams in Kinesis 
2. Create, describe and delete streams in Kinesis 
3. Append records to Kinesis 
To send requests to this REST API, the `user_posting_emulation.py` script was modified to include an api_send_to_kinesis function and a `user_posting_emulation_streaming.py` script to send messages to Kinesis through three endpoints (one for each topic), 
this adds one record at a time to the corresponding Kinesis streams.
Using the notebook `pinterest_steaming_data`, this data can then be read inside Databricks, cleaned and converted into Delta tables for a live overview.
